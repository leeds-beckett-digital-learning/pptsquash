# PPt Squash

This is an application and a software library for squashing PowerPoint files
beyond what is possible using the media compression tool within PowerPoint
itself.

PowerPoint files that contain embedded video can be huge - several GigaBytes.
The size can be reduced somewhat by using the compression tool within PowerPoint
but the highest compression setting still produces very big files.

Sometimes you need to share your slide show with people who don't need or
don't want the video content. For example, you don't want to force a blind
colleague to wait for two GigaBytes to download when they can't view the
video content. So, PPt Squash allows you to completely replace video with a placeholder
still image. After this processing the output file may be just a few MegaBytes.

*The original audio and video cannot be recovered from the squashed file and
so it is important that you keep the original version.*
